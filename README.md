# Iot-based-smart-agriculture-automation
its a embedded system project based on the idea of monitoring and controlling the basic farm activities over the internet. 

in the project the esp developent board is uses specifically esp8266 a micrococontroller from expressife technologies which is integtrated with the wifi module that can be programed to provide the internet connectivity. sensors are interfaced with the controller module to collect the data of the farm and these data is then sends to the thingspeak server using the rest api's then after further processing at the server side the server is program to take decision depending upon the result from the processing such as sending the alert message to the farmer via ifttt iot servises or to make any system on or off.

Hardware: ESP8266, temprature and humidity sensor, relay switches, indicator led's
Software: Arduino ide, IFTTT, thingspeak
