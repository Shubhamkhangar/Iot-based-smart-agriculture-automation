# IoT-based Agriculture Automation system

This project presents a smart agriculture and security system implemented using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller and various sensors. The system is designed to monitor environmental conditions in agricultural settings, automate irrigation based on soil moisture levels, and enhance security through a current fencing unit. The project leverages the capabilities of the ThingSpeak platform for data logging and remote command execution.
